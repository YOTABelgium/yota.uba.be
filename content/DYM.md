Calling all Young Amateur Radio Enthusiasts in Belgium!

This December, get ready to take to the airwaves during YOTA Month! I am inviting you to participate in this exciting event.

What is YOTA Month?

YOTA Month, short for Youngsters on the Air Month, is a global initiative dedicated to encouraging young people to explore the world of amateur radio. Throughout December, amateur radio operators under the age of 30 become active using special YOTA callsigns.

How can you participate?

    Get on the Air!
        Transmit from your local amateur radio club or even from your own home station (if you have one).
        Connect with other young radio enthusiasts from Belgium and around the world!

Ready to join the fun?

As a club manager, I would ask you to forward this mail to all youth operators of your club.
If you plan to transmit from the club station, the manager must also fill the form.

Fill out the short form to express your interest: https://forms.gle/zDpmPoZKFAfqh5TY6

Don't miss this chance to:

    Make new friends who share your interest in radio technology.
    Learn new communication skills.
    Contribute to a global community of young amateur radio operators.

We look forward to hearing you on the air during YOTA Month!

73 and best regards,
B. Cabay - ON4BCY | GDV
